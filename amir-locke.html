        <p>On April 12th 2021 my wife and I called a special "emergency" prayer and Bible discussion to talk about yet
            another instance
            of a Black person being shot by the police. Our friends who joined us were able to share, think, wrestle
            with the Word, lament, and pray.</p>

        <p>Sadly, less than a year later, I'm calling another emergency prayer and Bible discussion, this time for the
            shooting of Amir Locke. If you make it tonight at 6PM EST, then enter your details below and I will send you
            the Zoom link. </p>


        <p>On a personal note, the issue of injustice at the hands of the police is personal to my family. I've been
            stopped, searched, arrested, and threatened by the police over 11 times, since I was 16-years-old. The two
            most recent times include while I was on a prayer walk in Kernersville, and while I was walking back from a
            lunch break in Greensboro. </p>
        <p>So, what happened to Amir Locke is not "news" to me and my family. It's a mirror showing what could happen to
            me in my next encounter with the police.</p>
