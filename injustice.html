        <p>On April 12th my wife and I called a special "emergency" meeting to talk and pray about yet another instance
            of a Black person being shot by the police.</p>

        <p>In the above video we recreate the discussion we had with friends so that anyone who did not attend can
            benefit from it. </p>

        <p>We also made this recording as a conversation model for anyone who leads a small group at church. How can you
            talk about injustice in a way that serves everyone in the group, whether they feel personally affected by it
            or not. We hope this conversation demonstrates that answer. </p>

        <p>On a personl note, the issue of injustice at the hands of the police is personal to my family. I've been
            stopped, searched, arrested, and threatened by the police over 11 times, since I was 16-years-old. The two
            most recent times include while I was on a prayer walk in Kernersville, and while I was walking back from a
            lunch break in Greensboro. </p>
        <p>When I've talked about these events with Christian friends, some reactions have
            been helpful, and some have been harmful. My hope is that this video serves as a template so the next
            "Hashim" can learn what God feels about injustice, especially from the police.</p>
        <p>The video includes 3 scripture references:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Romans 13: God's plan</li>
            <li>Psalm 94: When God's plan is currupted</li>
            <li>Isaiah 1: The responsibility of God's people</li>
        </ol>
