        <h2 id="i-believe"> üôè I believe</h2>
        <p>that God is calling us to personal renewal and recommitment. And I believe God is calling his church to
            revival, love, and unity.
        <p>I used to be confused about if the Bible had answers to the issues we see in the church and in our country.
            But now I know for sure that if we embrace the surprising message of Jesus with an open heart, then we will
            naturally root out the worldly
            systems that discourage and divide us, such as sexism, racism, and nationalism.</p>
        <p>Now instead of reading a book, or listening to a person&#39;s opinion on these matters, I invite you to join
            me and my family as we read the Bible, discuss it with friends, and strive to live out God&#39;s word. </p>
        <h2 id="the-books-of-luke-acts">üìñ The books of Luke &amp; Acts</h2>
        <p>The issues in our society, in our churches, and in our own hearts are no different than what Jesus and the
            Apostles faced in their day. So instead of reinventing the wheel, we will read the message for us found in
            Luke and Acts. </p>
        <p>As we read and meditate, please ask yourself three questions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>What does this teach me about Jesus&#39; purpose?</li>
            <li>What does this teach me about the church&#39;s purpose?</li>
            <li>What barriers would stop me from making this my purpose?</li>
        </ol>
